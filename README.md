# synergy cares
Our goal is to empower independence in those who need help navigating today's healthcare system. We hope to provide 
services to member of the elderly and disabled population throughout the United States. We are about providing a warm 
meal to someone who can no longer cook or get out to get food. We are about obtaining care for those who can't care for
themselves. We are about transporting those who can not transport themselves to medical appointments. We are about 
reminding those who memory is not as good as it once was to take their medicine. We also provide homemaker services for
those who can't maintain their homes the way they use to. We are about providing companionship for those in need. Most 
of all we are about love and respect to those 
who need it the most.
